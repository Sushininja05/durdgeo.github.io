<h1>Commissions.</h1>
I've been asked if I do commissions before, so I've setup this page for all your commission needs!<br> 
I've never done it in any real capacity, but I figured it'd be worth opening myself up to.<br>
As such, here's all the useful information in case you were looking to commission me.<br></p>

<ul>
<h2>Terms of Use/Service:</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; color:gray; font-size: 9px;">(While I technically cannot enforce these rules, I am one guy after all, I would like it if you respected them.)</p>
<li style="font-size: 10px;">1. Artwork, once paid for and received, is to be retained as my "creation".<br>Meaning that I, Durdge-o, still own the art and can use it for future projects/portfolios/branding and other similar business.</li>
<li style="font-size: 10px;">2. Artwork, once paid for and received, by the client/purchaser, can use it for anything as long as it is their own personal use.<br>It may not be used for monetary gain, or sold as its own. (i.e. My artwork printed on shirts/stickers/keychains OR use in NFT/Crypto trading-- these use-cases are against my TOS.)</li>
<li style="font-size: 10px;">3. However, Artwork, once paid for and received, by the client/purchaser, can be used for projects with goals of monetary gain or commercial use within reason.<br>These exemptions from rule #2 are as follows: game development projects, album covers, comics, company logos, and other similar things. No royalties attached.</li>
<li style="font-size: 10px;">4. Once paid, allow time for me to complete your commission, I do not have strict deadlines as this isn't very professional, but I will try to complete your commission as soon as possible.</li>
<li style="font-size: 10px;">5. No refunds. I cannot refund you after payment is accepted and won't work on a piece until payment comes through.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
<h2>Art Guidelines:</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; color:gray; font-size: 9px;">(A small series of guidelines for commissions from me, so that you may get a better picture of my art... both literally and figuratively.)</p>
<li><table style="width:75%; padding-top:0px;">
<tr>
<td><li  style="font-size: 11px;">Will Draw:<br>Just about anything, can't guarantee I will be good at it though.<br>Will be more likely to draw art relating to things I like.<br>Can do NSFW/Furry/Mecha, but its not my wheelhouse.</li></td>
<td><li style="font-size: 11px;">Won't Draw:<br>Scat/Extreme Gore. Some cartoonier gore is still fine.<br>I may still turn down art requests of questionable subject matter.</li></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<br>
<li style="font-size: 11px;">Pricing:</li>
<li style="font-size: 11px;">Doodles - $15~$20<br>Prices go lower if the drawing is less complex, willing to do doodles of several characters at once at no additional cost.</li>
<li><img style="width:30%" src="art_images/likethis.png"><img style="width:30%" src="art_images/for%20doc%20ock.png"></li>
<br>
<li style="font-size: 11px;">Colored/Rendered Piece - $30~$45<br>Prices get higher with big backgrounds and rendering. I don't particularly like coloring.</li>
<li><img src="art_images/ouroboros%20background.png"><img style="width:15%" src="art_images/transparent_irisu.png"></li>
