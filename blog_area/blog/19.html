			  <h2>1. Since Last Build</h2>
			  So the last build came out and it didn't come out exactly as I wanted. 
			  I got a lot of useful feedback, people complained about stiff controls and low jump height, shitty level design n' whatnot.
			  I don't think I've ever considered the idea of "low jump height", but I explicitly remember making that a weakness of Grandman, so I didn't know exactly what to do. 
			  So I put that idea on the back burner and focused on fixing bugs first, so once I got done with bug-fixing I got back to it, which took a couple months.<br>
			  <br>
			  Now that it's Summer, I finally have the time to look into this again. 
			  I got some more opinions too, but the gist was:<br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>•Grandman is STIFF! (Translation: Charging feels bad, you have high traction, no momentum.)</li>
			   <li>•Jump height is LOW! (Translation: Platforms feel awkward, levels shouldn't be designed with things barely out of reach, jumping isn't "smooth" off ledges.)</li>
			   <li>•Game is CONFUSING! (Translation: Mechanics aren't obvious, things are poorly explained, overworld doesn't show you where to go, game doesn't "guide" you.)</li>
			  </ul><br>
			  To be completely honest, I still don't know how to solve these or if I have even solved them. 
			  But I'm trying! It'll be for you guys to judge next SAGE demo, so keep an eye out, okay? 
			  I am going to explain how I (kind of) solved these problems so far though.<br>
			  <br>
			  
			  <h2>2.a. "Grandman is STIFF!"/The Jump Height Problem</h2>
			  Whenever Grandman picks up an object, he's fucked, absolutely DOOMED. 
			  He can't charge which means he can't build speed and not building speed means you're not having fun. 
			  This is obviously a problem, but I couldn't just *make* you be able to charge no matter what, that would require me to rework the entire arm system. 
			  Or so I thought at least, I shopped around, did some tinkering, yeah... I was going to have to rework the entire arm system.<br>
			  <br>
			  Cool! That's one thing I'll have to redo, wasn't looking forward to that but whatever. 
			  Next, I realized the charging system ITSELF was slow and kind of clunky. 
			  Basically, all tech before relied on the fact that when you charged and pressed "S" during a charge it cancelled into a slide, giving you speed. 
			  This "Charge Slide" speed was initially really damn good, before I had figured out momentum and fine tuned everything. 
			  So I kept nerfing it and nerfing it, until this last update, where I realized most of the tech was worth centimeters at most, it wasn't satisfying. 
			  Charging capped your speed, doing a charge slide into a jump halved your speed, hitting the "goldilocks" timing gave you minimal gains, it all WAS NOT fun or worth it to perform the tech. 
			  The only thing worthwhile was "long jumping" (dubbed that due to having a similar input to the SM64 move), was performed by doing a charge slide the frame you jumped, sending you forward with no speed cap but instead a speed floor.<br>
			  <br>
              First things first, I smattered everything in leniency, tech should be easy.<br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>-You can crouch jump from a stand-still</li>
			   <li>-Pressing crouch and jump roughly near each other will guarantee a long jump</li>
			   <li>-Charging starts as long as you're holding the button</li>
			   <li>-A "Blue Charge"-state now is applied between certain "combo" moves that immediately gives your next throw charge</li>
			   <li>-There's now huge coyote time baked in</li>
			   <li>-You jump slightly higher</li>
			   <li>-Slope correction is slightly higher and an anti-ceiling bonk system is put in place so you can't hit corners</li>
			   <li>-You no longer drop items upon getting hurt</li>
			  </ul><br>
			  <br>
			  Secondly, I dumpstered everything that capped your speed, in fact I made some things GIVE you more speed. 
			  If it doesn't spark joy, it's gotta go. 
			  People like to be fast, I don't know why, but it's fun.<br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>-Charging gives you a burst of speed upon performing it</li>
			   <li>-Charging no longer caps speed</li>
			   <li>-Jumping out of Thud Jumps, Crouch Slides, Rocket Jumps, et cetera no longer slows you down</li>
			   <li>-Rocket Jumping now has an artifical "boost" which makes XSpeed decay slower and gain faster</li>
			   <li>-Wall-jumps (we'll get to that) completely redirect and boost your speed upon performing</li>
			   <li>-Skid jumps (we'll get to that) completely redirect and boost your speed upon performing</li>
			   <li>-Slope correction is slightly higher and an anti-ceiling bonk system is put in place so you can't hit corners</li>
			  </ul><br>
			  <br>
			  Thirdly, here's the kicker, I added MORE random tech and combined as many systems as possible. 
			  This isn't something most people think about, but moving around is less than the sum of your actions and more of the way you can cancel your actions. 
			  Fighting games, platformers, shooters, they all hinge on what goes into what. 
			  If I wanted my game to be fun, I would want to unrestrict the player's movement as much as possible.<br>
              <ul>
			   <li>Thud Sliding/Jumping + Fast Falling + Skid Jumping</li>
			   <li><img src="images/stomp.gif" width="100%"></li>
			   <li>Upon a thud all traction is removed from Grandman and his jump height is doubled, sounds useless but that means you can carry ANY speed with the right height. You can now hold "S" in the air to fast fall, ignoring YSpeed and making you hit the ground like a rock, starting a thud. 
			   Couple this with skid jumping, weapons, a slope, and you can fling yourself super far. Also, you can now "stomp" to do this at a stand-still. Cool, huh?</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br>
              <ul>
			   <li>Wall-Jumping</li>
			   <li><img src="images/wj.gif" width="100%"></li>
			   <li>These technically existed before but were either bugged or had a lot of weird restrictions. Now, they work about the same, you jump and you redirect all your speed. Skid jumping requires holding the opposite direction out of a burst of speed, then jumping. Wall-jumping requires a wall, simple enough. 
			   They're great ways to preserve and redirect speed without killing it, like a (turnaround) charge would.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br>
              <ul>
			   <li>Charging & Throwing</li>
			   <li><img src="images/newarms.gif" width="100%"></li>
			   <li>You can charge while holding stuff now, this is kind of surface level but there's a lot of smaller implications. Charging with weapons and objects means all sorts of slick tricks and cool setups.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br>
			  A month or so later, I had completely dumpstered my current movement code and built it from scratch. 
			  I had pretty much completely overhauled Grandman as a character, which will play more like, GRANDMAN. 
			  Grandman is his own thing, while he takes elements from Celeste, Wario, and Mischief Makers, he's GRANDMAN first and foremost. 
			  He's supposed to play into his own ruleset, he's supposed to stop on a dime and jump low, so this might not turn the heads of those who already disliked earlier builds. 
			  But that's OK! I'm making this game, for meeeeeeeee~.<br>
			  <br>
			  
			  <h2>2.b. Confusing Gameplay!?</h2>
			  It's no secret I'm bad at tutorials, sometimes I overcorrect and sometimes I undercorrect. 
			  I'm working on it, it's an iterative thing, I've got fixes in the works for most of the major issues. 
			  The laundry list being: <br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>-Menus are confusing -- SOLUTION: Menus are more streamlined and skip you through them more often.</li>
			   <li>-Grab mechanics are poorly explained -- SOLUTION: Redid OG level.</li>
			   <li>-Objects are poorly explained -- SOLUTION: Removed some more problematic ones, less problematic ones are getting tutorials.</li>
			   <li>-Weapons don't make sense -- SOLUTION: TUTORIALS, BABY!</li>
			   <li>-Bosses are incredibly confusing -- SOLUTION: Ever played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcGWQu1oDbQ">Mischief Makers?</a></li>
			   <li>-The Tech (which makes the game fun) is never explained -- SOLUTION: Making it easier, explaining it more, and making it somewhat mandatory.</li>
			  </ul>
			  To be completely honest, there isn't a good solution for these. 
			  Since this is a hobby project, I can delay and shop around for as long as I want until a good solution arises. 
			  As far as I'm concerned, I've narrowed down some of the more *obvious* things, so expect the next demo to touch on those. 
			  Until then, I'll playtest and playtest until it sparkles.<br>
			  <br>
			  
			  <h2>3. Watch for Rolling Scope!</h2>
			  Well past all the movement and gameplay overhauls, there's a LOT of objects to manage and add. 
			  This means fixing up menus, adjusting save managment, controls, bosses, levels, art, music, et cetera. 
			  Effectively, every time I add something to the actual game, that means editing my level editor and adding the necessary stuff for it. 
			  Then, playtesting and removing as many bugs as possible, which usually takes awhile and is iterative. 
			  Sometimes I even remake old mechanics to fix them up, in fact I've had to remake the enemy system *FOUR TIMES*.
			  Finally after all is said and done, I get to write down my progress onto my change list.<br>
			  <br>
			  Point being, it's a lot, and it gets worse with rebalancing, game restructuring, tutorializing, blah blah blah-- there's also been a bigger issue. 
			  See, the runtime has been shitting itself under my poor optimization and the weight of the engine, more or less. 
			  This has meant doing several optimization rounds, over and over, just to make it work on shitty junker PCs. 
			  In fact, you might've noticed all the gifs are on a singular test stage, that's because I've replaced *so much* that the **old stages don't even work!**<br>
			  <br>
			  Alas, the vicious cycle goes on, even to this day, but sooner or later I'll run out of infinite tasks to do. 
			  But, to hold you over, here's a little diagram of my time wasting.<br>
			  <img src="images/addition_cycle.png" width="100%"><br>
			  <br>
			  It'll all be done sooner or later, mind you, but I would like to stress that it's taking awhile for a lot of reasons. 
			  Not just laziness and real life obligations, although that has a factor. 
			  Please look forward to whenever I have more to say on it, I'm diligently working on it!<br>
