              If you've read the title, or read the little blurb I put near the image, you'll be sure what this is about.
			  Although not as whiny as the Grandman one, this is still just more complaining on my end.
			  This time however, it's not the lack of complaints, it's the abundance of them.
			  So let's discuss...<br>
			  <br>
			  No matter what, a game project will come out a lil' half-baked as to what you'd want.
			  Even complete winners have developer regrets and cuts.
			  Obviously, nothing will ever go perfectly.
			  More importantly, you can't just "go back and fix it", you can't "retry" an idea without making a new game.
			  It's harsh, especially in a cruel turbulent indie scene where most players will shrug your game off in mere seconds.<br>
			  <br>
			  But the feedback I got from Gamit was incredibly demoralizing.
			  I did it ALL right this time, I hit all the notes, where's the results?
			  Simple! You don't get em', that's that. You can't make anyone play your game without some convincing.
			  Whether it's a shweet trailer, brand recognition, word of mouth, a youtuber/streamer, whatever it is.
			  But what about the few who DO play?<br>
			  <br>
			  After all, it did hit all the notes, it performed much better than other projects.
			  What feedback did I get? Most players don't open their mouthes unless something pisses them off.
			  So it's not suprising it's been mainly silent. So that's surely a good sign right?!<br>
			  <br>
			  Well.<br>
			  <br>
			  No.<br>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Feedback is how I improve (how many others do too I'd assume) and this time nobody can really give me answers.
			  It's not the problem of "hate with no explanation", which plagues other creators that can't get straight answers out of people who say "fuck you and your shit game". 
			  In that case, you can only hope and pray as to what's truly wrong with your work. After all, there's always a reason for an angry player.<br>
			  <br>
			  But the lack of feedback and the lack of anger is just as deafening.
			  There's NOTHING you can do, there's NOTHING you can change.
			  Being told something like: "I like this but your controls are unintuitive.", is useless in more ways than one.
			  Not only does it raise a "damned if you do- damned if you don't" complex, but it raises the question of how unintuitive should you make your user design?
			  There's no answer, no solution, nothing besides to avoid the mechanic in it's entirety. It's a lot of the reason we see big time studios patch out "tech" and skillful exploits.
			  But this isn't to say I was introducing tech, I wasn't.
			  That's just the game. There's no way to fix that.<br>
			  <br>
			  But let's use another example, the one I think applies to EVERYONE, no matter what circle they fair in.
			  Time and dedication. It's the harshest and most unfair dictator of success.
			  If there's a pull, people will play, if there's a hook, people will play.
			  If you have neither, which I admit I clearly don't, there's no reason to play.
			  I think the best summary of this is something I heard from a friend.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>"you'd hope people put a bit of time to figure things out but when there are 3000 other games in their library, they just wanna know how to play instantly"</h1>
			  <br>
			  It's just the nature of development, time, effort, players, the human condition, and life.
			  There's nothing you can do, it's similar to sports players or esports players finally pushing the game to the absolute limit... and realizing it isn't fun anymore.
			  There comes a time where there's a complete lack of input of the developer's side, it's disheartening and takes the will to create out of you.
			  ----Not to say that this is a bad thing, sometimes you need to take a step back, but it sucks to give your all and have it melt out of your hands.
			  Maybe one day it'll find it's niche audience, things take time of course, but as a developer you can't rely on that to bring yourself places.<br>
			  <br>
			  There is one last thing though, competitions, expos, showcases, etc etc.
			  Dedicated way to get players. I've submitted to a few and that'll be another blog entry I'm sure, but for now it's another promise.<br>
			  <br>
			  One day I'll get my big break, but for now it's a story of the grindstone and work.
			  Everything'll eventually pay off, it's the joy of adversity. I can't wait to see you guys then.<br>
