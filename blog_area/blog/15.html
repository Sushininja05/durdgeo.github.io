              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">
              So let's get started.<br>
			  <h3>1. WELCOME TO THE INTERVIEW!</h3>
			  <br>
			  Hello bastards.. I am the man known as the "Big Bastard".<br>
			  Hear that? The big bastard. Remember it. Bastardly man...<br>
			  <br>
			  Apart from that, Howdy Fellas, I'm Max Konservsky, and I make games and other things for the peace of mind.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>2. How did you start making games and what inspired you initially?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I started making games back in 2013, when it came to me that there could be an easy way to make games.
			  So I looked it up and there were indeed programs that let you do that. The first program I landed on was Construct Classic, so I went with that.
			  I barely progressed over the next few years because tutorials used to invoke some kind of primal hatred within me, and since I didn't speak english I couldn't navigate the program well either.
			  But it was fun to mess around in it.<br>
			  <br>
			  The only inspiration I had back then were Jinxtengu's games, until it dawned on me in 2015 that I could try and create a space shooter, 
			  similar to the type of stuff i played when i was young, like Atomaders or Crusaders of Space.
			  I released about 3 games that year and not a single space shooter, but still it was fun.
			  I would usually work on something out of boredom during summer and then forget about the program for months.<br>
			  <br>
			  In 2016 when summer was about to come, I decided to revive some old projects but instead got inspired to make a brand new game inspired by some songs i listened to, and that's how Alien Invasion was born.
			  Shit, I remember it like yesterday, I really wish it was, good times. From this point on I realize that making games is real fun and I needed to do it full time.<br>
			  <br>
			  At this point I was still searching for the games I used to have on CDs when I was young, Shawn64 was a very inspiring figure at the time. 
			  I had only found out that he gave up the ghost 10 years after it had happened. Crazily enough the first time I played his games was a few months after he had already done it.
			  Still played Jinx's games at this time, although discovering Kubus rendered him obsolete for the rest of the adventure.<br>
			  <br>
			  I believe it was on a fateful evening of 29th (Or maybe 27th? I am looking at the calender right now and something seems off) of November 2016 that I ran into his games.<br>
			  Never been the same since then.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>3. For what reason do you keep reitterating the website and your games?<br>--What's your goal?</h3>
			  <br>
			  There is no goal, in fact. It is an endless cycle started off by me making the same mistakes over and over.
			  For some reason at the end of 2016 I felt like changing my alias and so I did, and for 2 weeks of the new year I made shorter, shittier games.
			  Until the 2 weeks came to an end and I nuked half of what was made and reverted all the changes.<br>
			  <br>
			  Then the same thing happened again (March - April), again (May - June) but this time I terminated everything completely at the end, then again (August - September), this time I went awol afterwards, coming back in late november I think.
			  Until Galaxa kicks off the whole thing all over, this time spanning 6 full months. If I had never decided to change the alias the whole cycle would have never kicked off, the website designs would never exist.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>4. What's your process for making games/art?<br>--How have you made so many?</h3>
			  <br>
			  This process can go in two ways, I either randomly come up with something that seems funny to me so I bring it to reality (Fuck Thermometer is the perfect example).
			  Sometimes I come up with a detailed game idea or story for a game and then make a game based on that. I've made so many because the bigger chunk of them was made with no effort in a few days or even less.
			  Not to say that I never made a good game in less than a week, but it is not something that should happen a lot.<br>
			  <br>
			  Additionally, especially during Galaxa, it was in a way a religious thing for me so i put out games like a conveyor belt. I do not recommend.
			  All of what I made fits into one single universe, there was a little information about that on Galaxa and as of right now I am preparing to put out full info on my current site.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>5. What's your best game in your opinion?<br>Also, what's your worst game?<br>Why are they the best/worst?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Can't do one, I think (this is where the list would be). They are the biggest games and the most fun to play.<br>
			  (Formatted in a list to make reading easier.)<br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>"Mr.Bean VS Scatman"</li>
               <li>"Bastards Fall Into The Void"</li>
			   <li>"Dad's Driving License"</li>
			   <li>"Rum IV"</li>
			   <li>"Rum VI: 5 Bottles of Rum"</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br>
			  Almost the entirety of my catalogue from 2017 and 2018 is godawful and many games can't even be called that.
			  So the worst thing i made that I CAN call a game would be "Christmas Massacre".
			  It took the longest time to make, 2 months, and came out boring and very generic.
			  I hated it from day 1 and immediately went in a different direction after making it. But I guess it was good learning experience.<br>
			  <br>
			  Here's a tip: If a game takes a long time to make, you are doing something wrong.
			  Put the pedal to the metal with your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel and put it out fast instead.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>6. What are your favorite games of all-time?</h3>
			  <br>
			  All time from the dawn of man???
			  I played Doom 3, Quake 1, 4 and Wolfenstein 3D into oblivion.
			  Deus Ex and both System Shock games, first two Fallout games are great too. Borderlands.
			  Both hotline miami games are great.<br>

			  I don't need to go on any longer.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>7. If there was one thing you could re-do in the past, how would you do it differently?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Brutal Opinion?<br>
			  I wouldn't have let myself put out effortless trash or start the whole redesign/renaming obsession. Should count as one big thing.
			  I have an elaborate, detailed plan of action on what to do in case i am sent back to the past.
			  I have travelled back in time in my dreams but then I wake up continue my travel to the future at the rate of 60 seconds per minute.<br>

			  <h3>9. Who are the patriots?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Who? Where. I don't think they exist.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>10. Who are the patriots?</h3>
			  <br>
			  The patriots are the essence of the country. Within themselves they run high-caliber thought processes which allow them to elevate a person beyond the capacity of human intellegence, say 
			  if we have a can of pepsicola and a can of puke, one makes you sick and the other one is just plain disgusting. Who would in their right mind give you such a strange choice? Besides,
			  the puke would have to be sterile to be put into a can, therefore it is most likely not puke as human mouth in not sterile unless you apply rubbing alcohol every 10 minutes for 24 hours beforehand.
			  Rubbing in in, rubbing it out, i know it rots the flesh inside, but outside you are still a human. Skin and bones, but alcoholic flesh, doesn't make you a heavy drinker does it? I knew a guy,
			  he attended alcoholics anonymous, goodness gracious, he was addicted bad. The night before he sneaked smokes into his living room while his wife was showering and lit them on.
			  Mind you, electronic smokes do not need to be brought near a lighter ever, as they may electrocute, but the man in question was ready for it. Which man? He crashed into, let's go back to the
			  can dillema. Can you drink a can of puke? Would you? You sick bastard, it is disgusting. In america they will sell canned puke as coca cola, fat people will buy and experience miraculous weight loss.
			  I mean, sugar free, cancer? I have a dream. I have a bike, blood red, stainless steel, steering wheel and an aircraft turbine. Not just one too. I tried driving one during a storm, the police pulled it over and then
			  i pulled off a big stunt, crashed directly into a statue. Semper fi to all the ravers in the nation. Going back to the topic of patriots, I saw one carry a big barrel down the road while I was in a taxi. I sucker punched the driver and then steered the car
			  at 900mph directly into the barrel which had illegal guadelupan turtles being smuggled across the pacific ocean. The turtles escaped and caused havoc in a local town so they sent in the paratroopers with a big gun mounted on top of a parachuting tank,
			  100 british tanks parachuted over the town and blew the turtle to bits. The turtle was in a fish tank with a goldfish the tank was I believe about 29 tons? Of course the original blast did not penetrate it's shields so I called up the cockroach man and he came
			  to my house and found bed bugs. They bit me and him and then my dog, so it said, and this is the dog talking now, "5 per day, about 35 a night", and the exterminator said "No such thing. I'd give it a ten", "Vielen dank meine unsere freunde?". The dog ranted about the
			  big bastard controlling the water supply so i went down the basement and put a GoPro Mega-Waterproof camera and after 10 days and 10 nights it arrived at the big bastard's office. He was riding a bike. It was dark red...
			  Help me please it is inside my Ipad Pro. The bike is cycling inside the Ipad and I am the only surviving person. I can hear the bike when i go to sleep. 872-6868-829, call me on my Nokia Xpressmusic Gorgonzolla Mobile Telecommunications service soon if you want the bike. 50 bucks.<br>

			  <br>

			  <br>
			  <h3>12. Yes or yes, is yes?</h3>

			  <br>
			  <h3>13. Sorry can't think of anymore lightning questions.</h3>
			  <br>

			  <br>
			  <h3>14. Nope nevermind, what's your opinion on sand?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I need to go back to the desert, so I can feel fresh again.<br>

			  <h3>15. Ok, back to reality. What are your favorite characters you've made?</h3>

			  They are all good fellas. Maybe Azariekel, the Jester, and Tetratheon.
			  Barfentine Barfentiner, Qlabardinchik, Garfus Giftmacher too.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>16. Any insight into how your characters/ideas came to be?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Power of the mind. Sometimes great things just come to me randomly.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>17. What do you think about the other camel websites?<br>--Your "contemporaries", if you will.</h3>
			  <br>
			  Brutal Opinion?<br>
			  Dany needs to put back his site, apart from that - make more good games.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>18. If you could drone strike anyone at this exact moment and be guaranteed to kill them who would you strike? You do not have to explain why.</h3>
			  <br>
			  Durdge is glowing... I do not consent.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>19. Future plans or aspirations for your site/games?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I need to put all the missing pages back onto my site,<br>
			  update and make games,<br>
			  there is a fuck ton of things to do.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>20. Finally, what's your catchphrase?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I'm a highway hero, doing two five zero, on the wrong side of the road!!!<br>
