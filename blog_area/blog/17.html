              Right... let's start.<br>
			  <h3>1. WELCOME TO THE INTERVIEW!</h3>
			  <br>
			  Hnumba one rule of life,<br>
			  dont be a bastardo<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>2. What did you do before making games?<br>
			  What exactly brought you into making things in the first place?<br>
			  (Pre-Sally, essentially.)</h3>
			  <br>
			  I have always wanted to make games since I was young really.
			  I always imagined the games I'd make and how they would be endless shooters with infinate wepon upgrades with endess levels n' shit.
			  When I was about 8 or 9 I moved schools, one day at this new school.
			  We ended up going to the nearby highschool to try to get used to the highschool environment.
			  One of the things we did was Scratch, and I enjoyed this so much that I started making them at home.
			  Now unfortunately most of these are lost, but there is still one of my old scratch accounts up on the internet.<br>
			  <br>
			  Feel free to play them here:<br>
			  https://scratch.mit.edu/users/reuben641000/<br>
			  <br>
			  But then, when it really got started is when I met my ex-best friend in highschool who was a big fnaf fan and was making fangames.
			  Of course I was interested in how he made them, it turns out he was using a program called Clickteam Fusion 2.5.
			  With this knowledge I began my "Real" game making journey, although I never really finished anything.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>3. What exactly got you into making games?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I dont actually know really.<br>
			  I find it hard to enjoy somthing without wanting to do it myself.
			  I've allways wanted to make games since I was young, but stuff like "Mario Forever" I played when I was like 6.
			  It was allways really cool to me that someone could just create their own mario game for the fun of others.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>4. Unlike most other Sunfish-based creators, your games lean the most on Kubus' design.<br>
			  What in specific makes you enjoy that style of work?<br>
			  Do you think you're faithful to that "branding"?</h3>
			  <br>
			  It feels honest, it feels like when you draw a picture but dont change any of it.
			  It feels to me like there is a story to be told. It feels like its completly random, but at the same time really very cohesive.
			  It also has me trying to guess what the intention behind the drawings are.<br>
			  <br>
			  For example: there is one game where a dude is on a magic carpet,<br>
			  but it also looks like he has his legs streight forward and back.<br>
			  Who knows what the intention was?<br>
			  <br>
			  Am I faithful to the style?<br>
			  Yeah I think so, making games in that style provides a sense of relief as I don't have to give a shit how stuff looks, haha.
			  (It also makes the art quicker to draw.)<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>5. What's game most adheres to *your* own unique "style", do you think it's good?<br>
			  What game is the least "your style", do you think it's good?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Sally 9, it is the catalyst for me finding my own style and you should expect to see more games of this type soon.
			  I also really like "Star legend Again?", its really simple but I think it has a lot of character.<br>
			  <br>
			  "Face Exploder 3" was probably the game that represents my artstyle the most.
			  I am remaking it in game maker with a similar (better) artstyle but I cannot confirm its release date.
			  I will put the unfinished clickteam version with the finished game maker one when it comes out.
			  Because I feel like it would be a waste of such a lot of time and effort not to.<br>
			  <br>
			  Ironically, I think "Johnny Forever" is my best game.
			  Despite it not using an original character, I really did try and get it feeling like a Johnny game.
			  But with proper levels and actual bosses, expect to see another one of these next Kubus day.<br>
			  <br>
			  "Rauul: Into The Sunset" is my most "Kubus-like" game I made I think.
			  The whole point of the game was to get it feeling as much like a kubus game as possible.
			  For this reason I don't like it that much to be honest.
			  I feel like the artstyle feels too forced and deliberate which goes against the whole point of the "kubus style" of making games.<br>
			  <br>
			  "Nose Milker 2" is also pretty kubus-y, but unlike Rauul, i actually really like this one.<br>
			  I feel like it's what a kubus game would be like if he knew how to code better hahaha.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>6. What are your absolute favorite things of all-time?<br>
			  In terms of games, music, art, or any other sort of media.</h3>
			  <br>
			  I love languages, though this has only been in recent years.
			  I came to the realization that its far easier to learn a language when you are younger.
			  So I have dedicated a lot of my time to learning foreign languages.
			  (even though my english spelling sucks dick)(editor's note: yea I had to edit a LOT in this)<br>
			  <br>
			  There is this ABSOLUTE king called Sunfish737 (no correlation to sunfish forums) most famous for his russian road song.<br>
			  He's a god at the accordion.<br>
			  <br>
			  Rodney Greenblat is also probably my favourite artist.<br>
			  My favourite thing of his is "The Dazzeloids", super underrated.<br>
			  <br>
			  I do really like "Revenge Of The Sunfish" still, it has been a inspiration to my games as always.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>7. What's your work ethic?<br>
			  How do you feel about inspiration and work?<br>
			  Where do you *get* your inspiration/motivation?</h3>
			  <br>
			  When a game makes me feel something, that's what motivates me the most.
			  My most intense experience with this has to have been "Revenge Of The Sunfish".
			  I remember watching pewdiepie play it when i was like 11, the sence of mystery it provided was crazy.
			  I remember watching hundreds of "let's players" play it and being really happy when the game would play out completely differently.
			  It really did (and still does) feel like an endless game with secrets still waiting to be discovered.
			  This is what is inspiring me to continue "Face Exploder 3".<br>
			  <br>
			  For my other games though, I just make them to have fun, not to be fun.<br>
			  <br>
			  Oh and there is one difference that I made when making my games that helped me a lot.
			  I switched from Clickteam Fusion 2.5 to Game Maker Studio 2.
			  It helped me actually complete things.<br>
			  <br>
			  For some examples, these 2 videos show how many unfinished games I have:<br>
			  https://youtu.be/MtAGUcUZS7w<br>
			  https://youtu.be/Xg7--O6yQJE<br>
			  <br>
			  As arrogant as it sounds, I never made a 2020 Fazill because I only had one unfinished project that I made with Game Maker.
			  Although 2021 has already proven itself to be less productive, so I might be making a fazill 2021.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>8. How do you go about making music in specific?<br>
			  Most people have their own "groove" and process.<br>
			  Would you say your process is any more or less erradic than others?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I have never really had a groove I get into when I make music.<br>
			  Literally all I do is open up my program and see what happens.<br>
			  <br>
			  All of my skills come from practice and just seeing what works, I know zero music theory hahaha.
			  As for my process being erratic, most of my best songs have been made in under 2 hours.
			  I don't know why, when I spend a while on a song it always sounds like garbage at the end because of all the changes I made to it.<br>
			  <br>
			  The only exception to this is my song: "Wester" as it took me about 2 months to finish and I still consider it my best song.
			  Some days I can make like 5 songs while sometimes it can take me a month to even make one.
			  I suppose it just depends on how I'm feeling that day.<br>
			  <br>

			  <h2>--Lightning Round--</h2>
			  <h3>9. Any superpower, anything, no rules, go.</h3>
			  <br>
			  All languages learnt<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>10. Who you pick in Mario Kart?</h3>
			  <br>
			  White Shyguy because Mario Kart DS Download Play has conditioned me to want to play as a Shyguy.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>11. You are in a flying bus, where do you go?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Oregon, because salvia is still legal there.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>12. Lightning round kinda sucks, do you agree?</h3>
			  <br>
			  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMmmMMmmMmmMMmMMMMMMM
			  MMMMMmmmmMMMMMmMMmmmmMMMmmmMMmmMMMMMmmMMMmmmMMmmmMMMM
			  sexMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmMMMMmmmMMmmmMMMMmmMMMmmmMMmmMMMM
			  mmMMMmmmMMmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmMMmMMmMMmMmMMmMMm<br>

			  HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEEEEEEeEeeEEeEeeEEEeeeeEEEeEEEEEee

			  <h2>--End Of Lightning Round--</h2>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>15. Any insight into how your characters/ideas came to be?<br>
			  Which ones are your favorites?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Sally is obvious, she is not an organic creation.<br>
			  I saw johnny and thought: "Yes I want to do that.", the names even sound similar hahaha.<br>
			  <br>
			  Zilch (Purple top-hat dude) is also one of my favourites.<br>
			  Me and a friend were just both drawing garbage in a notebook in school and idk I just drew him in like 30 seconds.<br>
			  <br>
			  Daxxio was made because I needed a third crusader for the Oopsie Daisy Crusaders.
			  But I didn't just make him out of the blue.
			  I was looking through pre-existing badcity lore to try and find something I could base a character on.
			  Then I remembered, that I made this song: https://youtu.be/mydamlSE-BE
			  I saw the eyes from the tree and thought: "Thats it, he will have three eyes and will be called Daxxio."<br>
			  <br>
			  Emboss The Doctor is a real bastard, he cures the k-rona with candy spray, then gives people lobotomies.<br> 
			  But his next challenge will be because of his own misdoing?<br>
			  <br>
			  Star 77, I just drew a silly face on a star because I liked the game name "Star Legend".<br>
			  <br>
			  The demon known as "Steel Bat" actually gets his name from a random thought I had.
			  I was playing Cave Story on hard tryin to be the doctor and I got pissed off at the bats that he shoots. 
			  So my head thought: "fucking god damn steel bats". Idk why, but that name stuck with me for some reason.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>16. If you could undo literally anything.<br>
			  What would you undo?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Saliva ban in the uk.<br>
			  shit sucks<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>17. What's the coolest looking hat?<br>
			  Anything really, top hats, bowler hats, etc etc.<br>
			  You name it.</h3>
			  <br>
			  Top hats are cool, but I dislike the posh attitude that comes with them.<br>
			  I wish they were chav-attire, so then we'd just have a bunch of Yobs walking around in top hats.<br>
			  It's great.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>18. Favorite thing you've ever made/done/said?
			  Practically anything, your choice.</h3>
			  <br>
			  My favourite thing I have made has to be Johnny forever.
			  I put so much effort into it, so many references and loads of secrets.
			  I really wanted to make the perfect Johnny fangame.
			  While I don't think I made the "Perfect" Johnny fangame i was hoping for, I feel I got pretty close.<br>
			  <br>
			  In High School I printed off probably in total 2000 pictures of the same angry dog.
			  Everyone had a picture of it, I would always go into the IT room at lunch.
			  Literally just spend the half hour there printing pictures. I never got caught...
			  Teachers knew it was happening too as well. I must have wasted sooooooo much ink and paper hahahahaha.<br>
			  <br>
			  I don't really have a favourite thing I have said. :(<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>19. Future plans or aspirations for your site/games?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Many a new game coming soon, games to look forward to are...<br>

			  It will be the game that puts me the in public eye. I can guarantee it!<br>
			  It will be so fucking good, your balls will explode from all the good shit.<br>
