			  <h2>YOU'VE BEEN HAD! ...I think.</h2>
			  Let's just get this out of the way quickly, there's a <a href="https://sushininja05.itch.io/wgcof-5">new game</a>! Wow! Ain't that something. 
			  I made it for Wet Gamin', so it's smattered in the website's branding stuff and all of the art assets are rushed to stay with the theme. 
			  To be honest, I don't like this game. I had a cool idea for the gameplay with the bouncy sort of "table tennis" gameplay of hitting Martin back n' forth, but it's just not executed well honestly. 
			  I procrastinated the game for over a year, rushed it out in a month, and ripped apart the game's script a few times just for the sake of brevity.
			  It's not my finest work, but it's something completed which is what matters.<br>
			  <br>
			  The idea was, I would quickly do this A YEAR AGO and then return to making Grandman without so much as a nod, then silently upload the game to Wet Gamin' (Who I will henceforth call WG) as a surprise. 
			  How did that turn out? Well, I was finishing up a difficult semester (both in terms of school work and people), then summer rolled around and much to my chagrin I STILL had more things to take care of. 
			  Good that I did, the things I setup over the summer have still been paying dividends for me. Just, not game dev-wise of course. That gobbled up the first 2/3rds of the year I would say.
			  So, was I making any progress at all? The short answer, no. I had finished half a cutscene, a script I ended up rewriting, and a few art assets.
			  How was I gonna get it done before the end of summer? I wasn't! With just a couple weeks left and school starting up, I cranked it out in a sort of fever.
			  First I finished a cutscene I had been procrastinating for the better part of a year, then chunked out the rest in a month.
			  It took roughly two months, which isn't GREAT timing, but hey it's <em>something</em>. I submitted it, hurriedly, to Dweedes and forgot about it.<br>
              <br>			  
			  Then a few weeks later, he actually got around to playing it and he caught a few bugs and other general stuff.
			  It wasn't fun to play and for whatever reason all of the playtesters just collectively didn't notice that you aimed with the mouse? 
			  So, in another rush, I spent 5 or so hours grinding apart the game to make it fun. Again, it was good that I did, the game sucked beforehand... but still.
			  I released it, found out just how hard it was to beat with the highest rank and how awkward the laser waves were, then cleaned that up for a post-launch update and that was that.
			  I don't particularly like the execution, the brand of humor used, the dialogue, much of it. It's kind of eeehh and not worth talking about.
			  Compared to the other chain games? I would think it stands out for having some real gameplay, but I think Jake Clover's is the funniest and the 2nd chapter (the computer one) is the most interesting.
			  I forced the story along and I hope that the guy after me figures out what to do with the pieces, at least people really liked what I did with Martin & Rando.<br>
			  <br>
			  Safe to say though, I don't like game jams, or working on games in a tight schedule.<br>
			  If there's ever a reason why I wouldn't do a patreon or kickstarter, it's that.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h2>Yellow Man Crossing.</h2>
			  Anyways, back to Grandman!!!!!<br>
			  WOO YEAAAHH!!!! HOORAY!!!!<br>
			  Right, well, with almost a year sacrificed to irl shit and a "small" project for WG, has there been substantial progress? 
			  Weirdly enough, yes. It actually got more work done on it than the WG game for some time! 
			  For some reason working on Grandman overrides that part of my brain that likes to procrastinate and take breaks, instead it's just a very slow gradual grind. 
			  Small adjustments, features, fixes, and other tweaks slowly get plopped into Grandman almost on a daily basis. 
			  Ideas form, congeal, and settle like cement over the months and more of the game starts to take shape. 
			  As such, Grandman is constantly being worked on, but it's not always obvious or big what I've been working on. 
			  The broad strokes, like completed levels, aren't getting filled in so much so as the finer details are being dotted and lined.
			  There's a lot of objects being fixed, menus being finished, and other functionality stuff slowly but surely coming together into a PERMANENT state.<br>
			  <br>
			  I've mainly been working on Grandman's moveset, I want playing as Grandman to be silky-smooth and for the player to fall into a flow-state. 
			  As such, I've been trying to force ways to maintain speed and do tricks into the moveset... like the clap, kick, et cetera.
			  I won't bore you with the details, I may make another dev log video or something to chronicle that, but just know that things are getting done and the game feels better than ever to play.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h2>THE GREAT SOCIAL EXPERIMENT!?</h2>
			  I'm starting to branch out again into social medias, for the sake of shilling of course, Twitter is """dying""" again and I think I'm going to start trying to use social media some more because of it.
			  I need to start getting the word out since I plan to release a demo next year and I want a good userbase leading into that.
			  The discord gets updated the very very most, but everything else is starting to get posted to as well. How long I'll keep up with that? Dunno!
