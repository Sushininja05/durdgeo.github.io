            <tr>
              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">Since the last blog entry,
              I've made a demo for the game, subsequently broke the enemy system and re-made it from scratch, optimized the engine & fixed weapons,
			  added content to the literal in-game instruction booklet, and changed many things about the game in general.<br />
                <br /> 
                That's a whole hell of a lot to cover, so I'll take it one at a time.<br>
                <br>
				<h2>1. The Enemies</h2>
				<br>
				The enemies were bug-ridden! Full of mistakes, issues with programming, inconsistencies and just overall broken.<br>
				<br>
                The enemies were awfully optimized, using excess objects and having excess scripting for each enemy type.
				Every enemy type used the same object creation/deletion/tagging system, but instead of having one function for all of them,
				they rely on an unique function for each of their setup. For example: Enemy A could be functionally identical to Enemy B but
				due to different animations, a different behavior, or an adjustment in health. They would have to be seperated and given their
				own functions and loops in order to create the objects responsible for the Enemy that are unrelated to the base object.<br>
				<br>
				The old system worked like this: 1. Upon the start of the level, it would take count for every Enemy and run functions for each one.
				This creates the objects, assigns the values, and appends each object to each individual base object.
				2. If object count for each individual object type appended to the base object exceeds base object count, objects are destroied. This
				is the start of the problematic behavior, because it doesn't know what specific object to destroy upon overflow. So it'll take away some
				random enemy's objects, now there is a lack of objects for one enemy. It realizes this and allocates another enemy's objects to that one,
				with mixed effects due to how fragile the nature of moving multiple objects around, often skipping enemies or giving a single enemy 
				multiple sets of objects.<br>
				<br>
				The solution was simple, I had to start over 100%, scrap all of the enemy work I had done up to that point besides art and concepts.
				This was awful! I had to start over with no refrense and no former systems, it also couldn't borrow anything from my previous attempt.
				I was pretty bummed honestly, but I ended up finding an example for scalable line-of-sight enemies similar to mine. It took me a 
				day or two to grasp the concepts, understand the scripting, and put it into practice using art from my own enemies. After I finished one 
				enemy, I sat down and re-made every single enemy using the new system and stress tested it every single step of the way to ensure I didn't 
				break or misuse the example in any way. This took me around 5 days.<br>
				<br>
				But it's not all doom and gloom! Sure it was a huge setback and most enemies are functionally identical, but in the process I caught many
				small errors that made the game way better to play without.<br>
				<br>
				For example: Non-melee enemies don't do damage upon touching their hitbox, buffing melee weapons and removing the danger from the Skoot-Board.
				I turned two risky playstyles into playstyles suitable for more casual play, and also making them more suitable for speedrunners. (Assuming 
				any speedrunners would play this game.)<br>
				<br>

				<br>
				Another BIG example: Pre-set directions & reliable behaviors! I know it seems obvious, like what game isn't super reliable? But if you've 
				played the Demo you'll notice that approaching any enemy required you to camp corners and bullshit the game. This was a huge thing in Sock-Man 
				but now it's practically the only way to play. So I had to make the enemies more reliable, predictable, consistent, but not remove the essence
				of engaging enemies. (If they're too predictable it curves the need to be good at all into the floor.) So giving myself the flexibility to 
				force pre-set directions within enemies on a individual basis allows for wackier level design and makes my life a whole lot easier. The behaviors 
				within enemies have also been simplified, changing direction off a wall will now yield consistent results instead of getting bullshit'd by some 
				enemy's wall bounce giving them the perfect line of sight of your next attack. Which obviously stifles progress and is annoying to deal with.<br>
				<br>
				The next entry will tackle Gamit & his weapons, and the changes that occured. See you next time.<br>
