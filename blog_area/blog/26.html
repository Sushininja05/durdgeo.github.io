			  <h2>IS THIS REAL?</h2>
			  I woke up, I was told "the TF2 comic released" and I immediately flipped shit.<br>
			  It LOOKED REAL. I went to verify right, no way this was real. I waited like 8 FUCKING YEARS for this, I reread the comics almost YEARLY! I DESPERATELY wanted to see the end of this. 
			  For something so near and dear to me, I wanted to know if they lived up to expectation. Did they meet my impossible demands? My figurative unknowable demands? 
			  Did these old Valve writers still have it? Is this hinting towards TF2 getting another update? The story progressing onward? 
			  Well, the story came to a close, so obviously it's not hinting towards anything new. But, by god, it met EVERY SINGLE EXPECTATION I had and all those I didn't know I had. 
			  You ever cry because something is so good? Because it's over? I certainly did. I don't know how to feel about that.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h2>ARE YOU SERIOUS?</h2>
			  I know it's just the TF2 comic, but this is such an extraordinary event I feel like I should chronicle this somewhere for future reference. 
			  Maybe you could use this to tell how much of a big TF2 fan I am later on down the line? Or maybe how much I love comics? Dunno! But I think it's worth writing this down.
			  TF2 is probably one of the most important things in my life, full stop. That's kind of pathetic to say, but it's gotten me through ups and downs, it's a solid rock I can always return to.
			  I've lived a pretty hectic life, most people do, I don't think I'm much different than others. But while others take solace in family or familiar sights/sounds/places, I took solace in TF2.
			  Rain or shine, I could hop in a lobby and enjoy myself. Very few people have something that'll lift their spirits like that you know.<br>
			  <br>
			  Despite the updates it still remained my favorite. Yeah, it gets updated in weird ways, I still think the Caber/GRU/Eviction Notice/Sandman/Ambassador should be reverted to their earlier stats. 
			  A few weapons like Warrior's Spirit/Pomson/Blutsauger/Overdose/Vita-saw/Enforcer/Red-Tape Recorder/Shortstop desperately need balance changes to not be pieces of shit. Also the Bison could use a hitbox extension + no dmg fall-off.
			  The Wrangler/Short Circuit need to get tapped in some way (i.e. put wrangler shield on the pomson? also make it so short circuit engies can't gain metal from carts AND gain metal with the weapon out) because they're fucking so unfun to fight against.
			  Also the old Panic Attack was beautiful and I miss it, please split it into two weapons-- one with the old stats (Sneeze Gun) and one with the new stats (Panic Attack). Not to mention, Spy is so horribly underpowered it's insane. Sniper is fine though please never touch him, thank you Valve.
			  BUT---! That's neither here nor there, okay? What's important is that TF2, a game that has clearly been on the back burner (hehe get it?) for Valve SOME FUCKING HOW got its last comic.<br>
			  <br>
			  If you're not a TF2 fan, this means nothing to you, so what? The final comic of a series that was getting one comic per every few years suddenly shadow-dropped their last comic? So what? 
			  Well, a lot of things. This effectively puts a nice bow on the game's story, the updates as a whole, the fact that the game has been in maintenance mode for years more or less, the fact that bots were such a big thing like a year or two ago... it's actually really sad and beautiful to me this is how it ends.
			  It's OVER, for better or for worse. I already knew it was over after Jungle Inferno's rocky reception and despite how much good that update did for the game there's still so much wrong with it. 
			  People came and left in droves, it still retains a lot of players but I don't believe they're ALL real people and it's obviously not as popular as before. 
			  Most of it (at least from my perspective) seems to be bots, server hosts, AFKs, et cetera. If the player base was so big, why are Oceania servers so fucking dead? Why is it so hard to find a game at those late hours of the night? I know that most games have healthier regions than others, but TF2 used to be untouchable everywhere. 
			  It was packed everywhere, at any day, any time, thousands of people you'd meet once and never again. Plenty of people whose stories you could learn about over a long match of 2fort, watch guys pour their hearts out over voice chat and laugh and cheer over the dumb antics players got up to in those matches. 
			  TF2 was beautiful. It was, and still kind of is, home.<br>
			  <br>
			  Casual has done a lot to try and preserve this stuff, it had to adapt in the modern age and I think it did okay enough. I still mourn the loss of Quickplay since it meant you got less wacky servers and there was less exposure to stuff like VSH for players. 
			  Only servers that made money would stick around for long periods of time, and as we all know, servers are VERY expensive to run and maintain.
			  Likewise, I think modern VScript VSH is pure ass compared to old VSH, but that's me speaking out of old-head anger. The type of anger that gets mad when something benign and inconsequential is just different, and that's scary to think about. 
			  Never thought I'd be old and curmudgeney(? did I spell that right? lol) over fucking TF2 of all things. But, to see the comic release, in this state of the game, in this way, it made me pause for a second. 
			  It's no secret TF2 has inspired a lot of my creations, it's driven me to become a game developer, writer, artist, and so on. It's had such an impact that surely I would be disappointed by how things turned out, right? How the comic had a 7 year delay? The bad updates?
			  But now I look back at everything that happened with TF2, and even though I can see where things obviously went wrong (looking at you Gun Mettle update! ...and Meat Your Match but who cares.) I can't bring myself to think they did anything wrong. 
			  Would I have wanted it to turn out a different way? I think the current state of things is actually kind of beautiful, serene even, like somehow despite it all nothing ever faltered. Do you know how hard that is? What the worth of these stories is?<br>
			  <br>
			  TF2, SOMEHOW, whether we like it or not, has REFUSED to die. Even though the status quo has changed, even though things will never be quite the same as those golden years around 2012, even though gaming as a whole is almost a completely different landscape. 
			  This FUCKER, is here to stay. The comic just cements this, it's not about the large gap between comic entries or the game itself, but the community. It pays homage to Rick May's death and all of the above relating to TF2. It ends in the only way it could have... with even more questions. 
			  A perfect ending tying up every loose end and confusing the hell out of anyone whose been following since the comics first started, like what even is the Administrator's motives? Why is there still no explanation for the Mann photo thing? Are they gonna tie up anything with Sniper's (alive) parents? 
			  Do those questions even matter? In my opinion? I'd say they don't! There's no better way for them to have wrapped it all up than for them to show Scout moving on and having their last bit of fun with Soldier, show the merc's endings, and finally demystify Zepheniah Mann. 
			  I love how they wrapped up Saxton Hale's story. I love how they made call backs to the things they've only mentioned in passing, the sheer amount of thought that went into this Smissmas Miracle.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>IT WAS WORTH IT.</h1>
			  <br>
			  There was NO better way it could have ended.<br>
			  This is how it SHOULD have ended.<br>
			  I only hope to see something this beautiful again in my lifetime.<br>
