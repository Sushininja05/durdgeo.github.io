			  <h2>Drink in the morning air.</h2>
			  I'm in a far better place than last year, just in general I've taken care of a lot of things that were weighing down my consciousness. 
			  It's great to finally say that in some form instead of just pushing through to the next task, but I'm starting to feel some real progress to my actions. 
			  It's a wonderful feeling to say that I'm making substantial progress on my projects again, that I've got plans for a better tomorrow, and that I'm doing relatively well on my classes. 
			  I may still have lots of work to do, in fact I'll be going over some of that in this post, but I think it's important to leave a section like this to mark change. 
			  Things are better, different, and it's all coming together.<br>
			  <br>
			  
			  <h2>Staring at the sun.</h2>
			  I'm actually unsure how much I've really shared about Grandman's development over the last however many blog entries. 
			  It's very vague, I'll say I'm "working on the engine" or "backend stuff" with no real end point. 
			  So I decided to take a peek at my to-do list and give you a bit of an idea of what I'm truly working on.<br>
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/exp1.png" width="100%"><br>
			  <br>
			  If I say I'm working on the Engine, assume there's a bug to fix or something of the sort.<br>
			  Recently, I was fixing the platforms, I've also being doing more nebulous things like improving the runtime and optimizing object counts/file size.
			  It's a lot of things that are hard to show or put a finger on, so I haven't really been sharing my development on any social media or my website. 
			  For instance: I need to redo how the grabbable floating platforms work, because they awkwardly snap into a solid state at seemingly random times. 
			  It's hard for the player to understand why or how they work, there's no visual feedback and it used to be done via a hidden timer and speed check. 
			  So, this """engine""" problem means I need to redo the object, some visual elements, and program in some new features. 
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/fixed.gif" width="100%"><br>
			  <br>
			  Done! That took like 5 minutes.<br>
			  Obviously, not all of my to-dos are this cut and dry, most take far longer to fix and there's a wide variety of stuff involved in even the smallest of fixes. 
			  So, why am I telling you this? Because my to-do list is 508 lines long, with varying degrees of tasks that range from: "Give Conveyor Belt Swap Block/Logic Signal variants" to "Redo Options Menu & Completely Overhaul Control System".
			  There's a lot to do, probably another year or two worth of stuff if I'm being honest. So please bear with my very slow development cycle.<br>
			  <br>
			  
			  <h2>Sweat and Concrete.</h2>
			  <a href="https://twitter.com/DurdgeO/status/1761728920410595380">If you haven't seen already, I've been slowly chipping away at some older levels as well.</a><br>
			  I broke all of the levels by redoing all of the objects, combining unnecessary ones and optimizing each one of them. 
			  This footage shows the currently only playable level, as I fix stuff the levels break and I have to redo them. 
			  So, slowly but surely, all of my levels will have to be redone to accomodate for Grandman's new radical movement and object changes.<br>
			  <br>
			  This level in specific has been through the ringer, a fix in one area will break something in another area, I've had to redo almost everything in this level. 
			  I redid the platforms, which meant redoing the whole upper section. I redid the breakables, which meant redoing the right section. I redid the turrets and bubbles, you get the picture. 
			  Funnily enough, this level is more fortunate than the others, I can salvage this level because it's newer and generally more fun to play. 
			  Everything in the first two worlds, save for a couple levels, is due for a complete replacement. I can at the very most, salvage my art assets and a few broad strokes of level design.<br>
			  <br>
			  Since I plan to be at SAGE this year, I'm going to aim for Deadlands (renamed Stone Zone, because I like that name better) to be redone and a new world added as well. 
			  The older worlds will take far longer, so I've decided to put them on the back burner in the hopes of having more to show. 
			  Although, I may still just decide to work on the older worlds anyways to dodge doing new art. It's undecided for now.<br>
			  <br>

			  <h2>Call my bluff.</h2>
			  As always, I'm on my various social media sites which you can use to keep up with me.<br>
			  I also have a discord now! Join that if you *really* wanna keep up with me.<br>

			  Since I'm still just as uneventful as ever, one of my friends have recently released a big project of their own.
			  I urge you to check it out! It's a pretty cool sort of platformer autoscroller game, I haven't seen anything else like it.<br>
