              To pick back up where my last entry left off.<br>
			  <h1>Part 1: After Gamit</h1>
			  <br>
			  Yep, it hasn't been all that great for Gamit, the showings at SAGE weren't very spectacular.
			  I more or less got the same feedback I had already gotten, it reminds me of a very very old quote I saw awhile back.
			  "Much good work is lost for the lack of a little more.", it's a shame really when you know that there's nothing wrong with your work.
			  There's nothing to really improve on that can be improved upon, at least this far anyways, there was a lot of root problems that bogged things down.<br>
			  <br>
			  Although in retrospect I think the mere fact that I finished it despite the odds is good enough for me.
			  I've had a very good track record in terms of completing my work and making use of every idea that comes out of my head in one way or another.
			  So Gamit's "final product" doesn't really surprise me, in fact my major hang-up is the fact that games are intentional.<br>
			  <br>
			  People can act high and mighty about bugs they've "found" or glitches or exploits, but the fact of the matter is that they're intentional.
			  Like it or not, any and all glitches are an intentional result of the developer, while they may be involuntary, everything when it comes to games are unforseen consequences.
			  I like to build my games in a very hands-off way, if something happens I let it take shape in the engine, that's how Grandman 1 was made and I'm not too broken up about that project.<br>
			  <br>
			  Sure, there's things I'd like to change, there's bugs I'd like to fix, but those were unconscious effects of my work and they just add character.
			  There's nothing worse than a dull game, sure you can be broken or fucked up but the moment a player deems you dull is the moment you've lost.
			  That's what I hope to avoid always, there's nothing worse than a boring experience.<br>
			  <br>
			  Submitting Gamit to SAGE was a good call and extended the playerbase.
			  While I'm not sure what I said in the last blog entry, I could care less since I don't even remember writing the damn thing.
			  But I was given a short review by a random player, here it is:<br>
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/review.PNG" width="400" height="100"><br>
			  <br>
			  This is probably the MOST I've ever gotten a look into what players thought aside from snide comments and backhand "reccomendations".
			  In a very literal sense, I just needed better polish. The equivalent of, ya dropped the ball at the finish line.
			  Controls, enemy AI, over-done tutorials, really it's a death of a thousand cuts and I understand it completely.
			  More or less, if you're well-acquainted to dealing with bullshit you'll adjust and conquer, if not you'll give up in 10 seconds.<br>
			  <br>
			  Par for the course really, pretty funny even.<br>
			  <br>
			  Thus, I move onto my next project, with the information I have from Gamit & the original Grandman, I'm sure you can guess what's next.<br>
			  I hinted at it awhile back with the "Retirement Moon" image, so if you haven't guessed already it's a Grandman sequel.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>Part 2: Grandman 2</h1>
			  <br>
			  I like the Yellow dude, who doesn't?-- Don't answer.<br>
			  <br>
			  Anyways, Grandman was the spark so-to-say when it came to my game development journey.
			  I really like Wario games and I'm still raring to finally prove myself and make a good Wario game.
			  So that's what I'm doing, with a heavy emphasis on the grab mechanics from Wario Land:Shake It! the game is just me having fun really.<br>
			  <br>
			  I can't possibly fuck anything up this time around, I have all the perfect makings along with an engine exactly as good as I want it to be.
			  Grandman is better than ever, the charge gimmick is way better defined, and progress has just been consistently flowing out.
			  I've genuinely never had a project go THIS WELL.<br>
			  <br>
			  Although there's a catch, some sorta-crash is fuckin' me over right now and it might take a bit but as far as I'm aware EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS.
			  I know, that's expected but it's big stuff for me.<br>

			  <br>
			  <h1>Part 3-ish: What Next?</h1>
			  <br>
			  While I'd love to leave you with a bag of empty promises again, I don't really care to.
			  I'm just going to keep doing what I've been doing and release when I complete stuff.
			  Blog entries whenever I feel like it, games whenever they're done, art whenever I update the site.<br>
