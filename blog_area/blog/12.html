              It's weird to say, but Mario Fangames have probably been the most influential thing on my life.
			  Most people have things like ROTSF or TF2 or other weird things as a sole-perpetrator of introducing werid shit to the masses.
			  After all, I did find a lot of stuff through TF2, and I'm not gonna downplay it, but my love for freeware truly begun with Mario fangames.<br>
			  <br>
			  Just in general, freeware is a really difficult realm to enter, you have to take a risk on the developer and the software.
			  It's possible that what you're playing may not even be finished and it defintely isn't curtailed to any professional norms.
			  Leading to a lot of confusing and underwhelming ideas, broken games, dumb bullshit, or offensive humor.<br>
			  <br>
			  But that! Is what gives it the CHARM! The SPICE! What ties the story all-together!
			  The most "memorable" Mario fangames were NEVER the properly built serious endeavours, it was always the dumb bullshit.
			  From Hypernova's games, Live in a buttock, Mario goes to see his great uncle in the USSR, Charisma Bros, Let's Go Thingio, etc etc.
			  Not to mention (non-mario for the most part); Sonic Robo Blast 2, Nintendo Nightmare, 3kliksphilip games, Spasman games, Hablo!, Sexy Hiking, etc etc.<br>
			  <br>
			  These games, along with a shitload more, are the main driving forces behind some of my favorite games. From Grandman to Gamit.
			  Especially Wario Destroys America, which was almost directly inspired by Let's Go Thingio. But there's more to the story...<br>
			  <br>
			  There's one game I've come to you to talk about today, the brilliantly shitty "Mario Quest" series.
			  It started as a very very small top-down shooter in clickteam, very poorly made with a bunch of shitty bosses and a cracked up story.
			  But the fact that the developer KEPT going, it only progressed, the ideas had to keep going, so they kept going.
			  The games are a GRUELING adventure with a LONG JOURNEY for every single entry, the plot is extremely slowly developing and awful.<br>
			  <br>
			  The first game is slow, awful, difficult, boring, and grueling. The plot has no substance, starting with Mario's car being stolen by Wario.
			  From then on it gradually starts grabbing every other character it can, building a bullshit plot with no reasoning.
			  The magic about this, stems from the fact that there's no direction, there's no rhyme or reason. It just keeps going.
			  Mario Quest 2 ups the anti in all ways, introducing car levels, upping the plot, making it more involved and bringing in Sonic as a driving foe again.<br>
			  <br>
			  It runs forward full-speed, despite the clumsy presentation, it's a perfect example of why fangames are great.
			  It's a perfect mass of unwashed potential, ideas, garbage, and true ambition. Despite any reasoning.
			  Which makes it one of the best games for a new freeware player to get into.
			  If you haven't played Mario Quest, it's on Mario Fangames Galaxy, (admittely a shitty community) a place with a good amount of weird shit.<br>
			  <br>
			  Getting into the medium shouldn't start with the best offerings, it should start with the most representative.
			  It pays to know the deepest depths before you play the creme of the crop, or else you'll have false standards and be unable to find new things.
			  Starting with something like "Revenge Of The Sunfish", could work similarly, but I'd say it's a bit too out there to properly represent the greater masses.<br>
			  <br>
			  Thanks for readin', I've been meaning to do this entry for awhile so I wrote it in like a hour for the purpose of having a blog entry to couple with this website update.<br>
