			  <h2>1. What's up?</h2>
			  <br>
			  As some of you know, Grandman 2 uses an array loader to load levels rather than having all the levels stored in the .exe.
			  This saves me boat loads of time when making levels and also allows me to do much much more creative things in less time.
			  The problem? It took awhile, like all good things do it takes TIME and EFFORT!<br>
			  <br>
			  Something that I've shyed away from, in all honesty, but after this year and a half or so of development I've got an engine 
			  I'm more than proud of that I can continously add onto with each passing day. That goes a damn long way for my creative work-flow 
			  as I've got less time than ever now, even passing features could be just too much to fit into a day, so I've optimized!<br>
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/editorexample.gif" width="568" height="320"><br>
			  <br>
			  Not only that, but I made a small lil' game for a game jam, it's called <a href="https://sushininja05.itch.io/kamg">KAMG</a>.<br>
			  <i>(Which I'm fairly certain absolutely bombed in terms of the jam's ratings but I don't really care.)</i>
			  <br>
			  Somebody even played it on youtube, surprisingly enough.<br>
			  <div id="player"></div>
              <script>
              var tag = document.createElement('script');

              tag.src = "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api";
              var firstScriptTag = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
              firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag, firstScriptTag);

              var player;
              function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {
              player = new YT.Player('player', {
                height: '390',
                width: '640',
		        //*Video ID here you dolt //
                videoId: 'mhzQu9yWfhY',
              });
              }
              </script>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <h2>2. Whazzis mean for Grandman?</h2>
			  <br>
			  Everything! I can add new features in a day, get a lot of work done, and churn out levels in a matter of weeks.
			  The problem is that there's still a lot of work to be done on the art-side, which I've never been good at and 
			  accidentally imposed a great work-load of it on myself this time.<br>
			  <br>
			  The backgrounds, while pretty (or at least I think so), are a huge ass time commitment.<br>
			  <img src="images/backgroundexample.png" width="800"><br>
			  <i>(Open this in a new tab, it's a huge image.)</i><br>
			  <br>
			  Something like this takes up to a week or so, depending on how detailed the enviornment I'm trying to show off is.
			  In fact, it's mainly a fact of just how damn big the game's resolution is compared to previous games I've made. 
			  It's the first widescreen Durdge-o experience. --and I wanna deliever as well as I possibly can!<br>
			  <br>
			  So, even despite the fact that the majority of the work is done for the game.<br>
			  I can't humbly expect to release it anytime soon...<br>
			  <h1>so I'll probably release early 2022.</h1><br>
			  <br>
			  If I can, I might be able to make a christmas deadline if I play my cards right.
			  Do expect another demo sometime in this year though! Potentially with <a href="https://wetgamin.com/"> Wet Gamin'</a>. 
			  The lads there have been pretty helpful, so kudos to em'.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h2>3. What can we expect?</h2>
			  <br>
			  Well, about more of the same, really.<br>
			  A slow update every once in awhile, y'kno the deal.
