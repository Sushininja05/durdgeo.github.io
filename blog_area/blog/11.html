              Let's get started.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>Part 1: Origins Of Gamit</h1>
			  <br>
			  I wanna say that I clearly 100% know when I first started. I don't.
			  In terms of "development" I don't have anything tying a date to the first day of development.
			  But I do have a design doc, from day one.<br>
			  <br>
			  <img src="images/DesignDoc.png" width="600" height="300"><br>
			  It's pretty clear to see, the game was completely different.<br>
			  <br>
			  It was much more a "Zelda 1"-style Sockman, with some baffling weird mechanics.
			  Instead of a straight-forward game with a mission strucuture.
			  With the intent being to slowly unlock all of these weird weapons depending on where you went.
			  Needless to say this is ambitious, it wasn't in the cards for me.
			  Not to mention, the fact that the whole game, even the main-protagonist, was made up on the spot, wasn't gonna go over well.
			  But, I pressed on anyways.<br>
			  <br>
			  Thusly, I started work, with the original goal in mind, as I finished the first enemy with left-over code from Sockman,
			  and it dawned up on me. I should just make another Sockman! That was the only game of mine that's done well!
			  So I finished the rest of the weapons, started work upon the enemies, and hit the biggest road-block I've ever faced.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>Part 2: AI, Enemy Design, and PAAAAAAIN.</h1>
			  <br>
			  During the development of the weaopns and movement, as well as the defunct knockback feature,
			  I had a single enemy which was a copy-paste of the chasers from the original Sockman.
			  That's fine and dandy sure, but there's gotta be variety for anyone to care.<br>
			  <br>
			  It took me about a week to develop the 12-ish enemies, with each enemy having a different pattern.
			  Although the differences between each pattern wasn't HUGE, especially with a few just being variants of the same enemy.
			  The job was done and they all acted differently enough for them to work properly in the scenarios I put them in.
			  Until, the first "stress-test", the original demo with the multi-colored background.<br>
			  <br>
			  Enemies worked. Until they didn't, they for whatever reason, would blip in and out of existence,
			  along with a huge laundry list of weird problems that made the game completely unplayable.
			  Couple that with the fact of the array of unbalanced weapons, I was back to square one.<br>
			  <br>
			  From then on, I reitterated the enemy system's Line-of-sight with 3 differnet variants.
			  I'll explain them now:<br>
			  <br>
			  Line of Sight:<br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>-A system where a "line-of-sight" object is shot back and forth, similar to ray-casting.</li>
               <li>(Died due to ineffectiveness with large amounts of enemies and general resource-intensity, also no "viewcone.")</li>
			   <br>
			   <li>-A system where a "line-of-sight" object in the form of a cone checks for collision.</li>
			   <li>(Died due to being hard to adjust for multiple different enemies.)</li>
			   <br>
			   <li>-A system where a "line-of-sight" object in the form of a line is streched to check for collision, along with another one for viewcone.</li>
			   <li>(Success! Easily adjustable, required a LOT of math and help from a few different people.)</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br>
			  The LOS-system's creation was directly tied to how I created the animations that were attached to each enemy's hitboxes.
			  So when it got better, the enemies started magically existing again. Although some rare cases may still slip through the cracks.
			  At that point, I had no lead on what caused it, nor a way to properly control it.
			  I basically had to pick up a new skill to get this far, and completely learn a new subset of programming, now you want me to do this?
			  Nope! I guess there's nothing I can do~<br>
			  <br>
			  Along with this, more than half of the behaviors of the enemies were borked, since I hadn't had any time to fully test them in-game.
			  Which meant I had to completely rewrite the behaviors of over half the enemies, introducing completely "new" dependencies and behaviors.
			  Along with more superficial balance-y things, like speed, health, etc etc. (Along with an array of interactions and misc mechanics-- a la MGS3-esque enemy stuff.)<br>
			  <br>
			  But once it was done, it was done. --And it shows! The new style allowed me to do a lot more than I could've otherwise.
			  It was powerful, resourceful, and adjustable. The trio of perfection for any developer.<br>
			  Here's even a nice lil' gif for it:<br>
			  <img src="images/hello.gif" width="300" height="300"><br>
			  <br>
			  Once the deed was done, about a year-and-a-half had passed.<br>
			  Keep in mind, on top of this intensive project, with a lot of ups-and-downs, I had to manage a lot more.
			  From moving, to infestations, school, other personal things, and making a joke-game whenever things were too hard for me to handle...
              It looked bleak. It was DEFINTELY not gonna release, there were no levels and I was planning to release this a year ago!?<br>
              <br>
              <h1>Part 3: The Return, menus and levels.</h1>
			  <br>
			  The menus were completed in about a month, with multiple different redesigns and the level-select originally being based off
			  the title-screen as a weird sort of "checklist" on the grass, where Gamit would use a highlighter to mark out completed levels.
			  If you're one astute enough to beat the game and find the secret download, you can look at the development of the menus.
			  Although they're nothing remarkable, even the old "checklist" idea didn't get preserved.<br>
			  <br>
			  After that, I hit the next big dry-spell, about a 6-or-so month period of complete inaction.
			  I made Wario Destroys America: Diskette B in that time-frame along with plenty of mods for other games.
			  I just had no idea where to go with the game, so I didn't go anywhere.
			  One day I opened it up, asked around and some people enjoyed it, so I started work.<br>
			  <br>
			  I made the first world, along with the key-rebinding system and the last few enemy adjustments and balance changes in this time-frame.
			  This period was the polishing state for me, if it hadn't happened the game would've played like trash.
			  I finished the demo, fixed some bugs with the help of the demo, and walked off into the sunse---
			  No, I just went on to finish the rest of the game.<br>
			  <br>
			  I made the designs for the bosses, volleyed the game around to some musicians and eventually landed on mikey0929.
			  Who was a great help in actually motivating me to get things done, instead of my previous musician who didn't really exist?
			  It was weird, but I put my nose to the grind-stone and got the last of the levels and bosses done with the motivation of a game-jam.<br>
			  <br>
			  I rushed it out, inevitably a few bugs skipped through, but I was done.
			  Now it was time for my musician to pull through, which took awhile, and it released.
			  Along with maybeee-- dropping a secret-boss I intended to add...<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>Part 4: Final Hours</h1>
			  This was the homerun stage so-to-say.
			  I was done, I compiled, checked for bugs, played through the game, added in my musician's music, called it a day.
			  There isn't much to say, but it was oddly surreal.<br>
			  <br>
			  I guess the idea of releasing it was such a foreign concept to me that actually doing it felt kinda wrong.
			  I feel like I need to fix something, like something doesn't work or something isn't right, but it's done.
			  I've heard some sort of addage from other devs about the whole-- "you don't get finished with something, you just throw your hands up and say it's done."
			  Which I can sympathize with to some extent, but most devs are self-deprecating assholes with no sense of motivation so I'm not inclined to believe it.
			  But it still felt wrong, so I decided to write this blog-post as a final send-off.<br>
			  <br>
			  Along with that, this blog post serves as a reminder to me on my time on this project, as well as a neat tie-in to say that I fixed the last of the bugs and I'll be releasing it later.<br>
			  <br>
			  My journey can come to a close, I'll see you sometime sooner or later with another non-serious blog post, because I need more of those.<br>
