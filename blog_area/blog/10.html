              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">So what's new? 
              Gamit's unwhelming arsenal has been buffed to hell.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>2. The Weapons</h1>
			  <br>
			  He's overpowered in every sense of the word, useless weapons have new meaning, every weapon is capable of one-shotting enemies.
			  Giving the game a more straight forward approach to combat, removing the style of gameplay I previously had in Sockman and instead
			  replacing it with a more amped up style of gameplay. Progression is tied to how you want to tackle things, like every game should.<br>
			  <br>
			  My goal was to make Gamit good enough to do anything he wants, but not good enough to remove the challenge from the game.<br>
			  <br>
              What better way to do that than to buff the tools used to make an ends to the means? Every weapon had unique issues, whether that's
			  the weapon being overly good, useless, broken, not skillful or balanced enough, or just being dumb. To tackle this I singled out 
			  every single weapon, looked at their flaws and strengths, and hammered them out in such a way to not only promote synergy but to make
			  every weapon unique in their own right.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h1>This logs all of the changes since the Demo, does not go over the weapons as a whole.</h1>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Downtown Menace</h3>
			  This weapon was really odd to fix. I don't really think I fixed it honestly, it's still the best weapon for overall gameplay and is the
			  perfect all-arounder's tool. It can do everything, short-range burst damage, long-range damage / harassment, ambushing, and corner 
			  peeking. It's honestly so well-made and good that there's no real way to fix it. If I "fix" it I'd be ruining what makes it appealing 
			  to begin with, devaluing the weapon and leaving nothing else to take its place.<br>
			  <br>
			  So, huzzah: I buffed the damage it does from 2 to 3. Adjusted timing on the reloads, removing the cap from the primary fire when using
			  the Stogie, and making the secondary fire do a little bit more damage.<br>
			  <br>
			  I decided that nerfing it would ruin it, so I made it better. Why not right? It's still not overpowered, but it is very very good no
			  matter what playstyle you're going for.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Handcannon</h3>
			  This was one of the few weapons I actually got feedback for, and it really shaped how I saw it.<br>
			  <br>
			  The major complaint was: the reloading sucked, and that it didn't do enough damage to warrant the reload. So like all things I ramped
			  that critique up to the max! It now one-shots every enemy except bosses, the reload mechanic was replaced with a more graceful one I 
			  took from an article talking about types of reloading within games and how to approach it. I wanted a more involved type of reloading 
			  which is why the original mashy reload came into existance, so I replaced it with a bar reload mechanic similar to Gears Of War.<br>
			  <br>
			  But that doesn't make the weapon, the damage was still an issue. It used to do 8 damage (the most any weapon did at the time), but it 
			  didn't feel as weightey as you can't see health bars. Most of the time it was an instant kill, but when it wasn't it felt off. Couple
			  that with the difficult to aim projectile and insane speed of the Handcannon and you didn't have a very consistent weapon. So I decided
			  to make the weapon an instant kill, no matter what as long as it wasn't a boss it'd do massive damage.<br>
			  <br>
			  The weapon now functions as a high-risk, high reward skill weapon, that offers the perfect solution to enemies for speedrunners and 
              more intense players. It could also be a player's best friend in the hardest difficulty, where you have little to no health and no way 
              to allieviate it. One shot could be all it takes.
              <br>
              <h3>Shovelizer</h3>
			  Nothing has changed! This has been one of the most consistent and well-thought out weapons I've made.<br>
			  <br>
			  I haven't had to change it since it's inception and it's worked well for it's purpose.<br>
			  <br>
			  To summarize the role of the weapon: It's the melee equivalent of the Downtown Menace, the perfect all-arounder that can handle any 
			  sitchuation and synergize with the other weapons. It does that perfectly, it doesn't need any buffs to make it more enjoyable or 
			  anything to nerf the expierence of weapon.<br>
			  <br>
			  As always, right-clicking stops enemies from getting closer to you and stops bullets. Effectively pausing time for Gamit.<br>
			  <br>
			  Similarly, since the dawn of time the left-click does a standard melee attack with good damage.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Zapp-Tapp</h3>
			  This weapon has had one of the most collosal changes out of the cast.<br>
			  <br>
			  In comparisons to others where I fixed them to actually perform the task they were meant to perform but for some reason didn't,
			  ones that were just straight up replaced with other weapons, or ones that got entirely new gimmicks, this one takes the cake.<br>
			  <br>
			  The Zapp-Tapp was a very complicated weapon to use when I first created it, having an obtuse homing mechanic that was difficult to
			  control and annoying to learn. The gimmick of it used to be stacking projectiles for massive damage, until I decided it was too op
			  and gave it the ability to level the projectiles but instead of multiple projectiles you only got one. So you'd have a big ball o'
			  hurt going around that was difficult to control and had better damage than the Handcannon.<br>
			  <br>
			  It was awful! The weapon couldn't perform its job well and when it did perform there wasn't a clear benefit as oppose to just doing
			  it the normal way with the Downtown Menace. It was inconsistent at best and just plain awful at worst, so I decided to remove the limit
			  on how many projectiles you could have out. Now it 1-shot everything, it preyed on the Handcannon's role yet again and not very well let
			  me remind you. Controlling the projectiles still sucked, so I made them adhere to the cursor more. Wow! Now it's TOO GOOD, and still 
			  steals the spotlight from the Handcannon.<br>
			  <br>
			  So, over the ????????? it's taken to write and put this blog entry up. I redid the Zapp-Tapp, with one simple change. Stun the enemies 
              instead of killing them! Wow! It does pitiful damage, gives them a stat debuff (invisible to the player of course) where the enemy is 
			  stunned. The stun goes away by one point every half of a second, giving ample time to setup stuff just off of 2 points. It stacks for 
			  each projectile launched, also the leveled projectiles deal extra stun. Each enemy has a unique animation for getting stunned, and a few 
			  enemies have special reactions to being stunned. These reactions (outside of being for balancing reasons) usually consist of the enemy 
			  freaking out or having some adverse reaction to being shocked, those that don't adhere to the norm usually get buffed by the shock or 
			  end up doing something weird.<br>
			  <br>
			  Shocking isn't it?<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Sydney Decapitator</h3>
			  This is a quick one.<br>
			  <br>
			  All I did was restore it's original mechanics in a non-broken state.<br>
			  <br>
			  It was supposed to go through walls, pick up health packs, grab enemies, and deal consistent damage. But I broke all of those for some 
			  reason? Now the weapon is super consistent, does very bad damage (as always), but makes up for it by pulling enemies around with it and 
			  avoiding walls (also picking up health packs whenever it comes around one).<br>
			  <br>
			  The worst weapon is now a fighter for the top slot all because a developer made a mistake. Aren't you glad the game has been so delayed 
			  now? Dev Delays = IMPROVED GAMEPLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Wit's End</h3>
			  Another Sydney Decapitator case.<br>
			  <br>
			  Although pretty similar to the Sydney Decapitator's fix, I've adjusted a lot of small things to make it more consistent and more enjoyable 
			  to use. But it has endured many changes, mainly unrestricting the weapon's attributes and putting more power in the player's hands.<br>
			  <br>
			  Small animation fixes, just like all of the throwing weapons. But now it's manually detonated with the right-click, there's no cool-down,
			  no timer, bounces forever, consistent bouncing, 32-angles. It seems over-powering, with disgusting crowd control and overwhelming options
			  in every sitchuation. But it never gets to be "the best", held back by the lack of explosions when connecting with other enemies. The 
			  explosions you sling around have just enough of a chance of hurting others, as they do hurting yourself.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Rife Rifle</h3>
			  Despite the color change, there hasn't been very much of a change. 
			  This weapons is 100% the same as it was before, small bug-fixes and damage buffs.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Satanic Solvent</h3>
			  The SS was given 3 cups to put the "liquid" in, they explode into bunches when shot.<br>
			  <br>
			  They look to be on the chopping block so I won't write much about them, if they make it to launch then you can expierence them for yourself.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Soldier's Stogie</h3>
			  The only weapon completely unchanged from the Demo, and even it's inception!<br>
			  <br>
			  Everything has had bug-fixes, animation changes, buffs, nerfs, etc etc. This still just makes you slow, takes HP, and cuts reload time by a 
			  huge margin. Using an auto-clicker, the Handcannon and Downtown Menace can crack out loads of damage, although they're not the most effective
			  damage dealers.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Skoot-Board</h3>
			  The Skoot-Board's animations were fixed, you can now hop off of it using the Shift key! And...... yeah. Still just a movement item.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Judge's Maul</h3>
			  You're no longer super slow, still slow though.<br>
			  Changed the alt-fire to primary fire, made it block bullets.<br>
			  Alt-fire now slams down leaving cracks in the ground, cracks + hammer deal damage.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>Return To Sender</h3>
			  Consistency was the major problem with this weapon.<br>
			  <br>
			  It wasn't consistent at all! Unreliable and broken at times, useless most of the time.<br>
			  That's completely fixed! The ball launches way more consistently, you can return volleys when it comes back to you!<br>
			  Yeah I mean that's it.<br>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  This entry has taken forever, oops! I was really running out of speed by the Wit's End so I rushed the rest out just so I can get this 
			  out of my backlog.<br>
			  <br>
			  See you next time, with misc fixes.<br>
