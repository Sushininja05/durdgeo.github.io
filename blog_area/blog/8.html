              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">So first of all, what's the outline for Gamit? 
              Gamit is being developed by me (of course), Music (this time not in a Radio App) by Catface, and it's a top-down shooter similar to Sock Man.<br />
                <br /> 
                I've always kept coming back to the ideas present in Sock Man, I feel that with a little work it would be infintely better and be overall rad.
                I realized that the major problem with Sock Man was entirely the character / enemies. Sock Man felt rigid and moves too slowly, the enemies aren't
				smart enough to feel dynamic or work in the enviornment they're in. This was compounded by the existance of the Follower enemy which was unbelieveably
				over-made and it actually supported LOS Lines, Viewcones, and an alert status.<br>
				<br>
				So I applied the tech I used to create the follower to every enemy, creating a variety of enemies with different weaknesses and advantages. Which was
				already a major step up! The game was instantly better, but the main character still felt rigid and awful.<br>
				<br>
				Unlike enemies, fixing the main character wasn't all too simple, as there were an array of issues I had to solve;<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
				<li>-Making Gamit feel as responsive as something like Hotline Miami while still holding the same feel as Sock Man</li>
				<li>-Multiple weapons / abilities that give extra options to the player</li>
				<li>-Touhou Focus mechanic + Hotline Miami Zoom</li>
				<li>-Complex animations, polish, and overall good feel</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				At this very point in time, I can say I've more than reached all of these goals! 12 Weapons to choose from, Focus / Zoom, well-made animations, polish,
				and cool options like a Fake Death Pill!
				<br>

				<br>
				The game also supports rebinding of your controls, incredily over-done menus, and lots of great music from our friend Catface!<br>
				<br>
				I'll be releasing a demo some time in April, so stay tuned! Thanks for reading.
