                So, to put it simply. ALL of my work halted due to school coming round and really messin' me up! I decided during this winter break I would remedy this, by doing the impossible....<br />
                  <br />
                Finishing Fun Zone, renovating the Art Section, creating my own game section (fuck itch.io lol), and sorting my priorities out for my next game project.</td>

              I have been being a lazy IDIOT. Starting a Grandman sequel, finishing the assets, and then being lazy about completing the level editor that is required for the game.
              Creating Fun Zone at a SNAIL'S PACE, basically making progress every 2-4 weeks when I'd get bored and try to "make progress".
              What have I done then? If I'm """making progress""" like I said.<br> 
			  <br>
                REAL WORK:
                <ul>
                <li>-Insane work on a new game's engine known as "Gamit", will be releasing a blog entry on that. (Exclusive Gamit in ART AREA!!)</li>
                <li>-A NEW series on my youtube channel known as the "Day Series", no structure and no form. Perfect for what I create.</li>
				<li>-Restructuring of MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL! Allowing access to legacy videos and overall better stuff.</li>
				<li>-MIGRATING HOSTS OF MY WEBSITE!!!</li>
                <li>-Fun ZONE.</li>

				<li>-TWITTER ACCOUNT, ALLOWING ME TO INFORM YOU ALL EASIER ON MY STUFF.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                Yeah okay cool so who cares? I can't even see the majority of these immediately.<br>
				<br>
                1. shut up idiot   2. this is literally everything I was promising and more! 3. if you honestly don't care at all then why are you here?<br>
				<br>
                So what's coming down the pipeline? Because I'm not just gonna sell you a bed of lies like before.<br>
				<br>
				
				COMING SOONISH?:
                <ul>
                <li>-Demo + Video for the finished Gamit engine</li>
                <li>-Grandman Sequel sporting a level editor and loads of fixes, not as story rich but defintely wayy fun.(?)</li>
				<li>-HTML Games on the new Fun Zone games!</li>
				<li>-Games for download in the new games section!</li>
                <li>-More videos, more blog entries, more fun stuff! (Probably at a moderate pace assuming life obligations don't take over)</li>
				<li>-SUNFISH 2 COLLAB! (Coming soon to the ART AREA upon it's completion, 6 spaces left.)</li>
                <li>-LOADS OF NEW ART!</li>

                </ul>
				
				<br>
				The Durdge-o Land wasn't very strong near the end of last year, but we WILL recover.
				There will be a renaissance in this land.<br>
				<br>
				We will uphold the status quo--- the world is NOT ENOUGH, and change it to fit our needs.<br>
				<br>
				Thanks for reading, have a good one.<br>
