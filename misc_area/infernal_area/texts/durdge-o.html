      </big></font><font color="lime" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">1.  Hello Durge-o, are you ready?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>Yea dude I have lots of hands for typing this.<br>
      <br>
      <big><font color="lime" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">2.  You have recently released a game called "Pogo the Game",  what inspired you to make it?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>Actually its a long story, I played a game by Magicdweedoo called
"Ticket". Which inspired me to make games again, since I had already
tried to make games while failing before.<br>

The game I started my "career" on was called "Project TV", it was meant
to be a small platformer but it bloated in size and I didn't make games
for awhile due to lazyiness. <br>

I started the idea for "Pogo The Game" cause I loved "Ticket" and
wanted to see more games like it, but didn't know about the communities
like glorious trainwrecks.<br>

Since I loved it so much, I started speedrunning it. Which only made me want to work on making games again.<br>

I took ideas from many games, and lifted assloads of mechanics from my canceled "Project TV" game.<br>

<br>
3. What was the most fun part of the creation of "Pogo", and what part was the most boring?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>The most fun was the first 5-6 hours, creating the game mechanics + the
actual coding (that wasn't levels) was the most enjoyable thing ever.
Since it is really fun getting set up.<br>

&nbsp; The most boring part was creating levels, due to my mechanics I had
to create spacious levels.<br>
And the level development part of games is
boring as fuck, so it was just a overall bad expierence.<br>
      <big><font color="lime" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><br>
4.  Are there any good games that you would like to recommend?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>Good games? I play a lot of dumb games but here are some favorites:<br>

-Thingio: Side A (The inspiration for me even starting to make games in the first place.<br>

-A fun game with odd ideas and mechanics a stupid story that will have
you smiling from ear to ear. As well as the plethera of secrets in the
game, its just an enjoyable time altogether.<br>

https://mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb&amp;param=02&amp;c=2&amp;id=5278 I
urge you to play this game, it is my #1 pick for a game ever.<br>
      <br>

<br>

MFGG also has a lot of good fun games, so you should play some of the games on it too.<br>

https://mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb&amp;param=01&amp;c=2<br>
      <br>

-Nintendo Nightmare<br>

-An old game and odd game for sure, but very fun. I don't want to spoil
the story, but if you love story based platforming adventure games this
has got you covered. A bombastic story with <br>

amazingly stupid ideas that somehow makes it all work. The game sadly
is very difficult and long, so if you aren't ready for a 3-4 hour
expierence then It's not for you.<br>

-Nusty Flamingo Tango ( A recent one, but still really good.)<br>

-A game with really no story, but an amazing art style and fun
platforming. A dumb (in the good way) game all around that is worth
playing if you enjoy games from Magicdweedoo or Glorious<br>

Trainwrecks. <br>

-Ticket ( Of Course)<br>

-This game blew me away and it shows me what people can do. It is an
amazing game and I love the game, the game is good since it is a good
game you should play it.<br>

Shut up and play it holy shit, this is the only game that you must pay for out of this list but it is beautiful.<br>

5. What games do you think really suck?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>If I were to put out a clearly hated game, I have only one answer.<br>

-Fortnite<br>

-An overall bad game that isn't very fun or skillful, it is annoying to
play and does nothing but piss players off during the gameplay.<br>

If you enjoy the game, that is your choice. But fuck this game.<br>

If you want to play this game, do not there are better options that are similar.<br>
      <big><font color="lime" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><br>
6. What is your favorite weather?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>I gotta say:<br>

-Rain<br>

-A nice type of weather cause it looks nice. Other than that, my family often gets headaches during it.<br>

So I don't have to deal with them + sometimes I get days off due to headaches that run within the family.<br>
      <big><font color="lime" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><br>
7. It's riddle time...<br>
A man on a bike challenged an old guy on a bus - whoever gets to the nuclear bomb first, wins.<br>
But 30 minutes later, it was reported that both of them died in a concentration camp.<br>
What went wrong?<br>
      </font></big><br>

Hmm, here my best """answer""".<br>

      <br>

-This is a bus to a concentration camp, the man on a bike was forced
into the bus with the man. The nuclear bomb sent by people to blow up
the camp was defused, but not by either of them.<br>

Instead they were killed trying to stop the bomb from going off.<br>
      <big><font color="lime" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><br>
8.  If you will make more games, what do you think you will make?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>Magicdweedoo.<br>
-I make whatever games I want, and what genre I tackle next is the one
I go after when I want to make it.<i><br>
      </i>Just like magicdweedoo, who is the
only reason I made games in the first place.<br>

9. Your catchphrase

      <br>
10. Final words?<br>
      <br>
      </font></big>Assuming this is in the context of when someone is about to kill me:<br>

      <font color="red"><big><i><b><big>"you all are large fucking idiots"</big></b></i></big></font><br>
