      <span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">1. You have made 2 games, how does it feel? Any interesting experience you want to share?</span><br>


      <small><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">


      <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">A
lot of things happened during this year, my discovery of Kubusian and
Jinx's works finally led me to a community of creative people. I feel
like I gained more appreciation for the true, independent art, and even
though several scandalous events happened, that made me leave Jinx's
forums, I still consider myself a part of the wonderful world of good
stuff! I've never created games before, but I actually searched for
some game-making tools, and stumbled upon OHRRPGCE just before joining
Jinx's forums in March (or which month was that? I forgot...). But I
actually got into making games thanks to your encouragement, and began
my work on "My Head Hurts Like a Bitch". Making games feels awesome!
Free, easy, yet versatile programs like TGF can really open up the
creative potential of a person, I truly believe that - and coupled with
independent spirit and inspiration from Kubus, you can create gold out
of dirt and snot, even if some still think it IS dirt and snot.
Unfortunately, OHRRPGCE turned out to be a tool which is still being
developed, and has some bugs, like random crashes. It is sad that
underground gamemakers depend so much on the choice of right
programs... I think it's a big problem. So, I've lost a good deal of
courage because of the bugs, and the development stopped. Back then I
already knew a little about the Glorious Trainwrecks site, which is
nothing I've ever seen before. The place supports and encourages the
true art in the form of computer games! You told me about an event
there, and I decided to give it a try... I had to learn TGF quickly,
and it turned out to be very simple to use! The French programs like
TGF and Klik are genuinely beneficial to the creative potential, they
aren't focused on marketing schemes or boring rationalized programming.
A true gift for the artists! Though I'm more inclined to the art of
writing, I find myself strangely between the world of
philology/philosophy and the world of computers... I try to make that
into my individuality. So... ahem... back to the game. Before the
event, I already had an idea about creating a game about hallucinogenic
cacti. It was to be a game with a light-hearted, adventurous
atmosphere. I think I achieved that, judging from the comments my
Peyote Runner received on GT. I received inspiration mainly from the
film "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", of course, which is one of my
favourites. I support many views of Hunter Thompson on journalistics
and perceiving life in general. I met several technical difficulties,
but together with some users we made the game playable. Then, I had a
pretty lengthy hiatus, which brought about many strange events, but
none of them made me finish the work on my second (actually, first)
game, My Head Hurts Like a Bitch (also known as "the sauna game"). The
game is darker than Peyote Runner, obviously, but it is also more
contemplative and is more narrative-like. It's a story of a single
thought on saunas, and my views on it. I think that saunas (meaning
mainly Russian Banyas) are a kind of "forced pain" we have to go
through, the needless excess of heat from it really gives me strong
headache. I tried to find the answer on how the pain could be used, and
how to accept it in me without sacrificing anything - i.e. not
"enduring" it, but making it a part of me, find something hidden in it,
something real, and not illusionary. That's what it's about, and I
think people got it, when it was finished in late August despite my
severance from Sunfish community (which is now complete, though I still
wish the forums well and respect many of its members I got to know
during my time there). Sadly, I had to ignore the unfixable bug which
caused crashes, and it probably still scares people away from trying
the game... I hope the positive comments will make people interested in
it, this game means a lot to me. Regarding my future in game-making, I
hope to make more games soon - though probably not in OHRRPGCE, likely
in TGF, since the former with its crashes would make longer games
(which I plan to make) too annoying to play, and I do not aim for that.
You can include somewhere after the interview my views on art and
game-making in general which I wrote once in response to yours, this
will make people more familiar with my philosophy, hopefully. My
creative spirit grows stronger with each game made, and I can feel it.
I wish all of you who make strange little free games the same!<br>

      <font face="courier new, monospace" size="5"><small><br>


      <span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">2. you said that you've got
some inspiration from Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas for Peyote Runner,
but has anything else inspired you? Any games, music, movies?</span><br>


      <br>


      <small><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Yes,
while Fear and Loathing was the main inspiration, I also used the mood
of another movie about H. Thompson, called "Where the Buffalo Roam".
There are no elements from that movie in the game per se, but the mood
is there. Especially the last part, where the Weird Monster finally
reaches his home - it is inspired by the lines "Oh give me a home,
where the buffalo roam... where seldom is heard a discouraging word and
the skies are not cloudy all day". Also, maybe an obscure Japanese
movie "The Insects Unlisted in the Encyclopedia". I'm aslo interested
in psychedelic culture in general, I've read some books about peyote
cacti, and plan to read more. From music, you can probably guess it's
psytrance, mainly 1200 Micrograms, and the song "Mescaline" in their
first (and best!) eponymous album. The Daggerfall music in the end was
an odd choice, it is used mainly because it's a "lost track" which
wasn't even used in the original game, despite being quite cool (and
having themes of travels, adventure and possibly "wisdom" of sorts), in
my opinion... now it finally found some use in my game!<br>

      <br>


      <small style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">I
have some ideas on a few games already, and though I'm not nearly as
prolific as Kubus or other game artists out there, the inspiration does
visit me at times. I'd say, expect some games with more weird gameplay
and probably longer levels in the future! I lack the experience with
game-making programs, so I need to experiment a lot. But I do not worry
about lack of ideas, I think they come quite easily to my grasp.</span></small><br>

      <br>


      <small><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Any
highly militaristic games, sport simulators, anything with lots of
insults towards players, any MMORPGs and also probably any online FPS.
I feel very uneasy about games which have subtle political message or
try to become a media-virus.</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">

      <span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">6. What's youre favorite Kubus movie?</span><br>


      <br>


      <small><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">All
of them are the best movies I've ever seen, plus I heard there's one
which is not yet discovered. But I do have an absolute favourite among
them! It's "Rats for Dinner"! I really liked the scene where Amund is
mixing something sinister out of strange ingredients... Reminds me of
one of my bad childhood habits!<br>

      <br>


As a bonus, today, we have Macabre's views on game creation:</small><br>


      <br>


      <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">MACABRE'S GAME CREATIION RULES</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">


      </small></small><small style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);"><small><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">My morals regarding all creative works usually are:<br>


      <br>


1. Trying to make the work absolutely free, and useful to somebody -
note that useful doesn't necessarily mean it must provide
super-enlightenment or be "socially useful" - bleh! - no, not like
that, more like about bringing good mood and evoking interesting
emotions, thoughts. Not pure dumb relaxation or entertainment, usually
- more like the "healing" effect on soul, to feel better during
depression. Sometimes it's okey to make something that satisfies the
need for relaxation or knowledge, too.<br>


      <br>


2. Avoid trying to look like a super smart-ass by offering boring or
overly agressive riddles and challenges. I'm more comfortable with
"indifferent" approach of Kubus, where you CAN make your game (or some
other work of art) hard to understand and play, but you make it
silently, and don't make a statement like "if you don't know how to
play it you're stupid by default" or "for elite people only". The
hardness should be natural, and should come from your heart. If you
have some complicated feelings you can put them into the game in form
of a riddle/difficult gameplay as a sort of psychotherapy. I think this
is what Kubus was trying to do.<br>


      <br>


3. Never buying that "be original" crap. It's very silly. Do what you
want! - said Kubus. And he was damn right. If I want to make it a bit
repetitive and boring, nothing should stop me. It might turn out to be
quite original in the end. Again, if it comes truly from your heart, it
will ALWAYS be original. I hate when people make a race for seeking
things that are "fun" and "original". Like when they see something that
doesn't make them laugh their ass off or jizz in their pants on sight,
they say it's "boring" and "unfunny". Very dumb approach to art. The
whole mainstream industry of entertainment (like games) is based on
that. And most of it is utterly boring shit. Why does it happen?
Because they always pursue that "be original" idea, while forgetting
about the idea itself. They search for the same "fun" shit over and
over, they don't understand that they are actually making no progress.
While a guy like Kubus creates 100+ free games with crude graphics and
simple gameplay - it may seem like he is not making any progress, just
repeating his ideas (like with endless Johnny games), but the guy
actually EXPLORES the idea, and even out of single idea he manages to
squeeze out a lot of stuff! And it was TRULY fun, and TRULY original.
He is not afraid to take his time, to release things when he wants.
When he is ready, he moves on to try new idea. I support your rule
about taking long breaks. Taking your time sounds very good!<br>


      <br>


4. I don't have many "technical" rules, but I personally stick to using
free game-making programs, trying not to show off my game-making skills
- if I learn some new tricks, I'd rather use them when they are really
needed rather than putting them everywhere (though it may be fun
sometimes, and if it's for fun, and not just for showing off). Copying
ideas is bad, but getting inspired by things is okey. Especially if
you're inspired by some weird things - not necessarily someone's weird
games, but also films and the like. Hell, even being inspired by a
rotten leaf on the road is good! You get inspired by the works of
Mother Nature herself!! I'm not afraid to use "copyrighted" stuff,
because nowadays people try to make copyright even trees, air, land and
water, which are nobody's but mother nature's. Using some things like
random pics and musics and mixing them into a nice pile of trash is
great, I think, and nobody should be offended by that - except if they
are overly greedy and malevolent. Of corpse simply copying and not
using it as a material for something else is something I'd rather avoid
- not much because it's someone else's but more because it's simply
counter-creative</small></small></small><small style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0); font-weight: bold;"><small><small style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">.</small><br>
