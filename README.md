Welcome to my website! You can access it here: https://sushininja05.github.io/
There's a full "mission statement" that explains the purpose of this website, but if you want a shortened version as to why this exists, here you go.

I made this website to host projects since some of my friends were doing it back in 2017~ or so.
This was originally hosted on Neocities but I decided to move it after due to their annoying file limits, refresh rate, and update log.
I also just wanted my files to be transparent so other people could reference my shitty, mostly stolen, HTML & CSS.

Thanks,
Durdge-o
